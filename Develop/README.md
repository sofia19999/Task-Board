### Task Board Application


## Description

The Task Board Application is a web-based project management tool designed to help teams organize and track tasks efficiently. This Kanban-style board allows users to add, update, and delete tasks, as well as move them between different stages of progress (To Do, In Progress, Done). The application features a clean and intuitive interface, color-coding for task deadlines, and persistent storage using localStorage, ensuring tasks are saved across sessions. 

## Features

* Task Management: Add, update, delete, and manage tasks.
* Drag-and-Drop Interface: Easily move tasks between columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) using a drag-and-drop interface.
* Persistent Storage: All tasks are saved in localStorage, ensuring they persist across page refreshes.
* Deadline Management: Tasks are color-coded based on their deadlines—yellow for tasks due today and red for overdue tasks.


## User Story
As a project team member with multiple tasks to organize,
I want a task board,
so that I can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress, and track overall project progress accordingly.
